As the director of rangeela this year i want to create a website for rangeela, where students and alumini can go to find pictures and vidoes from past shows.This year will be the 23rd year rangeela as been in existence i think it will be a great tribute to the ISDO for their hard work. We rely soley on calvin to host some , i stress some of the photgae and also since we always have copyright battles with calvin i though it wise to have our own hosting site , this would make the organiztion more professional and get external funding from alumini 


Possible team mates : Megan koh , Kelly oh ,
