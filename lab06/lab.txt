6.1 You can send get requests in the browser (posts can be used in forms in browser). 
Requests can be seen in the network tab
Clicking them gives you their info. 
 Jquery is another method of sending requsts in the browser, but the browser always does get request to see info.

Curl uses get, delete, put and post. In the browser you load everything for viewing, The browser gets into and posts it if nescescary. 
Curl can  interact with HTTP links.
